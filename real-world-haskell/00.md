# Introduction: Why Haskell? Abstract

Haskell is a deep language with a lot of different approaches. Learning them is hugely rewarding experience.

## Novelty

Haskell is different from what you knew before. You will have a different mindset on software.

In Haskell there is no code modifying data. Instead functions take immutable values to produce other immutable values.
Given those inputs functions always produce the same results.
Functions usually don't interact with outer world (these functions are called __pure__).
There is a strong distinction between pure code and code that reads files, interacts with netword etc.

Haskell is lazy: all computations are postponed until their results are required.

## Power

There are powerful alternative to traditional approaches from other languages in Haskell (such as for loop).\

Since there is much more pure code (which is easier to test) in Haskell programs, they remain solid and reliable.

Lazy evaluation gives some benefits.
For example if you want to find k least-valued elements in unsorted list,
first you can sort it and take first k elements.
In traditional languages this is a bad approach,
since it is expensive to sort the whole list. In Haskell it is fine,
the whole list won't be sorted, if we don't access all the elemnts.
